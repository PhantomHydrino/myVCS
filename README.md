## _My Own Version Control System (hence myVCS, hehe)_


I just decided to make my own version control system for fun... and to fill my resume a little bit.
So yeah, its a little version control system build in  ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3670A0?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=ffdd54)

## Features

- Initialiasing a new repository using ``` main.py init ```
- Adding files to commit using ``` main.py add <your_file> ```
- Commiting your changes using ``` main.py commit -m "your_message" ```
- Checking config of your repository using ```main.py config```
- Checking status of your repository using ```main.py status```
- Checking logs using ```main.py log```
- And more features like Branching and stuff which I have planned on developing in the future.

Its a very small version control which I plan to build further and improvise as time progresses, but the aim of this project to me was, to build a little version control of myself which I can run locally on my system in order to have full control of whatever I commit, just for fun.

## Tech

This project currently uses [Python](https://python.org) for simplicity reasons(in terms of coding of course..), but I might proceed with a better tech in the future, preferrably [Go](https://go.dev)....(who knows)

## Installation

Install the dependencies.
```pip install requirements.txt```

Run the program.
```python main.py <commands_listed_above>```


### THANK YOU AND SEE YOU AROUND!
